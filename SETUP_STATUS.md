# Meridian Setup Status

## Current Status
As of May 16, 2025, the following setup steps have been completed:

1. **Database Configuration**:
   - PostgreSQL database configured with connection string
   - Environment variables set up for database access
   - Database migrations successfully run
   - Seed data added with 10 RSS feed sources

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Created necessary `.env` files in:
     - `packages/database`
     - `apps/frontend`
     - `apps/scrapers`
     - `apps/briefs`
   - Added Python `requirements.txt` for the brief generation component
   - Python environment configured with necessary dependencies

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Local development environment partially configured
   - Frontend can be run locally with `pnpm dev` in the `apps/frontend` directory
   - Scrapers service can be run locally with `pnpm dev` in the `apps/scrapers` directory

## Issues Identified

1. **API Authentication**:
   - API calls require a valid `MERIDIAN_SECRET_KEY`
   - Current test key ("sk-this-is-my-dev-key-123456") is not accepted by the API

2. **Worker Service Conflicts**:
   - Port conflicts when trying to run multiple worker services
   - "Address already in use (127.0.0.1:9229)" error when starting worker service

## Next Steps

1. **API Configuration**:
   - Update `MERIDIAN_SECRET_KEY` in all `.env` files with a valid API key
   - Test API connectivity with the updated key

2. **Service Startup**:
   - Start the scrapers service: `cd /Users/m/Projects/meridian/apps/scrapers && pnpm dev`
   - Start the frontend service: `cd /Users/m/Projects/meridian/apps/frontend && pnpm dev`
   - Resolve port conflicts by updating ports in configuration if needed

3. **Brief Generation**:
   - Once articles are scraped and processed, run the brief generation notebook:
   - `cd /Users/m/Projects/meridian/apps/briefs && source ../../venv/bin/activate && jupyter notebook reportV5.ipynb`

4. **Testing**:
   - Verify RSS feeds are being scraped correctly
   - Check article processing is working as expected
   - Test brief generation and frontend display

5. **Deployment Preparation**:
   - Update Cloudflare Worker configuration for production
   - Test end-to-end workflow before full deployment
   - Document any remaining configuration needs
